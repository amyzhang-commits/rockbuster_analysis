--'district_histogram'
--This table records the count of districts, grouped by the number of customers in each district, ranging from 1 to 10 customers. 
The subquery isolates the logic of grouping by district and calculating customer populations. The outer query then analyzes these results (grouping them by population size and counting districts). (Subquery runs first.)
