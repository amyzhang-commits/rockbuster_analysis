# 📼📊🍿Rockbuster Stealth LLC - SQL Queries
📌 **Project Overview**
Analyzing Rockbuster Stealth LLC’s 2005-2006 rental data to uncover trends, optimize customer targeting, and guide the launch of their new streaming platform.

**Key Insights & Recommendations**:

✅ Normalize Customer Behavior Metrics
To avoid overestimating market potential, focus on normalized averages rather than raw totals—especially given Rockbuster’s highly dispersed and unevenly distributed customer base.

✅ Top Growth Genres (Normalized by Inventory)
Sci-Fi, Action, Animation, Classics, and Drama show the highest growth potential. However, in outlier countries (where rentals per customer are unusually high or low), a localized genre analysis is recommended.

✅ Retention Strategies Needed
Rental frequency and spending decline as customers move from “New” to “Long-Tenured.” Implementing subscription models or loyalty programs can stabilize long-term revenue.

✅ Late Fees: A Risky Crutch
Over 25% of revenue comes from late fees—a fragile source as streaming competition grows. Introducing tiered subscription plans would help transition to a sustainable revenue model.
